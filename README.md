# Roberts-Drinking-Database
My first interactive database created with Python. In summary, this code provides a GUI interface using a custom Tkinter-based GUI framework called "customtkinter" for managing drink orders, inventory, and user information using a SQLite database. It allows users to add new users, place orders, view inventory, and retrieve information such as order history. I undertook this project to create my first interactive database using Python and Tkinter. I wanted to develop a program that could efficiently manage drink orders, inventory, and user information, providing a practical solution for organizational purposes. This project also served as an opportunity for me to try out a new programming language, develop skills, demonstrate my abilities, and give experience.
